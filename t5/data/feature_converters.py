"""Feature converters for common architectures.

We provide feature converters for the following three architectures:

  - encoder-decoder
  - decoder-only
  - encoder-only

The feature converters are composable mapping from tf.data.Dataset to
tf.data.Dataset. In other words, one or more compatible feature converters can
be composed together just like t5.data.preprocessors.

The input dataset has the fields or keys that are defined by the
`output_features` of the Task or Mixture under consideration. Often, these
fields are "inputs" and "targets" or just "targets" for the decoder-only models.

The role of feature converters is to convert these fields into a more
descriptive set of features to the model.


Definition: standard_features

Throughout this module, we refer to the following 10 fields as
standard_features. Depending on the model architecture, a subset of them will be
returned by the feature converter.

  - encoder_input_token
  - encoder_target_token
  - encoder_loss_weight
  - encoder_position
  - encoder_segment_id
  - decoder_input_token
  - decoder_target_token
  - decoder_loss_weight
  - decoder_position
  - decoder_segment_id

  *_segment_id and *_position are only relevant for packed dataset.

  *_segment_id is an tf.Tensor of integer which is aligned with
  encoder_input_token. Positive integers represent the sequence membership in
  the packed examples. 0 represents padding. For example, encoder_segment_id =
  [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0] means that the first two positions belong to the first
  sequence, the next three to the second sequence and the last position is a
  padding.

  *_loss_weight is used to indicate which positions should be used for the loss
  calculation.


Underlying assumptions

The feature converters implemented in this module assume the following about the
input dataset.

  - If a field requires an EOS token, it is already added prior to the
    converter.
  - Each field has length less than or equal to the lenghth specified by the
    input `sequence_length` argument. In particular, it is not padded yet.
  - The input dataset is not batched.
  - Each input tensor is one-dimensional (i.e., the length dimension).


For use-cases not covered by these standard cases, users need to define their
own feature-converter.
